        <p><i> "There’s an audacity to the way the Arctic Monkeys' fifth album gathers disparate musical threads—West Coast hip-hop, heavy ’70s rock—into something that feels so assured, inevitable and outrageously enjoyable. From biker-gang stomp of “Do I Wanna Know?” to the bouncing G-funk of “Why’d You Only Call…”, they turn the sounds of their adopted Californian home into a set of can’t-miss instant classics. Seductive, slinky and brimming with nocturnal attitude, <i>AM</i> is the sound of a band locating a sonic sweet spot no one else thought to look for."</i></p>

            Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type<br>
            That sticks around like summat in your teeth?<br>
            Are there some aces up your sleeve?<br>
            Have you no idea that you're in deep?<br>
            I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week<br>
            How many secrets can you keep?<br>
            'Cause there's this tune I found<br>
            That makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat<br>
            Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee<br>
            If this feelin' flows both ways?<br>
            (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay<br>
            (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made<br>
            For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day<br>
            Crawlin' back to you<br>
            Ever thought of callin' when<br>
            You've had a few?<br>
            'Cause I always do<br>
            Maybe I'm too<br>
            Busy bein' yours<br>
            To fall for somebody new…<br>

            I'm a puppet on a string<br>
            Tracy Island, time-traveling<br>
            Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches<br>
            Come to find you four in some velvet morning<br>
            Years too late, she's a silver lining<br>
            Lone ranger riding through an open space<br>
            In my mind when she's not right there beside me<br>

            I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be<br>
            And satisfaction feels like a distant memory<br>
            And I can't help myself, all I<br>
            Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"<br>
            Well, are you mine?<br>
            Are you mine?<br>
            Are you mine? Woah, ah<br>

            I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end<br>
            Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes<br>
            Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days<br>
            Great escape, lost track of time and space<br>
            She's a silver lining climbing on my desire<br>

            And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be<br>
            And satisfaction feels like a distant memory<br>
            And I can't help myself, all I<br>
            Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"<br>
            Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)<br>
            Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)<br>
            Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)<br>

            And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways<br>
            So in case, I'm mistaken, I<br>
            Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby<br>
            Are you mine?"<br>
            She's a silver lining<br>
            Lone ranger riding through an open space<br>
            In my mind when she's not right there beside me<br>

            I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be<br>
            And satisfaction feels like a distant memory<br>
            And I can't help myself, all I<br>
            Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"<br>
            Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)<br>

            I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go<br>
            Will you pour me one for the road?<br>
            I knew this would be on the cards<br>
            I knew you wouldn't fold<br>

            Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart<br>
            Some out of tune guitar<br>
            Soundtrack to disaster<br>
            Ooh ooh, one for the road<br>
            Ooh ooh, one for the road<br>

            She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit<br>
            And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams<br>
            My days end best when this sunset gets itself<br>
            Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side<br>
            It's much less picturesque without her catching the light<br>
            The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes<br>
            As Arabella<br>
            As Arabella<br>
            Just might have tapped into your mind and soul<br>
            You can't be sure<br>
            Arabella's got a seventies head<br>
            But she's a modern lover<br>
            It's an exploration, she's made of outer space<br>
            And her lips are like the galaxy's edge<br>
            And her kiss the color of a constellation falling into place<br>
            My days end best when this sunset gets itself<br>
            Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side<br>
            It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
            The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes<br>
            As Arabella<br>
            As Arabella<br>
            Just might have tapped into your mind and soul<br>
            You can't be sure<br>
            That's magic in a cheetah print coat<br>
            Just a slip underneath it I hope<br>
            Asking if I can have one of those<br>
            Organic cigarettes that she smokes<br>
            Wraps her lips round the Mexican coke<br>
            Makes you wish that you were the bottle<br>
            Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like.<br>
            Just might have tapped into your mind and soul<br>
            You can't be sure<br>

            So you're on the prowl wondering whether<br>
            She left already or not<br>
            Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna<br>
            Never knowing when to stop<br>
            Sunglasses indoors, par for the course<br>
            Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls<br>
            Cages and poles<br>
            Call off the search for your soul<br>
            Or put it on hold again<br>
            She's having a sly indoor smoke<br>
            And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends<br>
            Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes<br>
            As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach<br>
            And it seems as though those lumps in your throat<br>
            That you just swallowed have got you going<br>

            She's a certified mind blower<br>
            Knowing full well that I don't<br>
            May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her<br>
            Just to get the ball to roll<br>
            Drunken monologues, confused because<br>
            It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya<br>
            To do me no good<br>
            And you look like you could<br>

            The "She's with me"s, the Gallic shrug<br>
            The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus<br>
            The black & white and the color dodge<br>
            The good time girls, the cubicles<br>
            The house of fun, the number one<br>

            <br>Like the beginning of Mean Streets
            <br>You could be my baby

            <br>You could be my baby (but the number was blocked)
            <br>You and me could have been a team
            <br>Each had a half of a king and queen seat (when you've come undone)
            <br>Like the beginning of Mean Streets
            <br>You could be my baby
            <br>When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
            <br>When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
            <br>When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
            <br>And your knee socks
            <br>When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
            <br>When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
            <br>When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
            <br>And your knee socks
            <br>Knee socks

            I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
            <br>Breathing in your dust
            <br>I wanna be your Ford Cortina
            <br>I will never rust

            <br>Secrets I have held in my heart
            <br>Are harder to hide than I thought
            <br>Maybe I just wanna be yours

            <br>Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
            <br>Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
            <br>And let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
